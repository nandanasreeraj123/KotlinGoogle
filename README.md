# Kotlin Project

This project aims to create a basic Kotlin program implementing various basic concepts of Kotlin.
This Kotlin program implements Classes and functions. Inheritance property is also demonstrated. 
Various Kotlin Concepts like arrays, pairs, lambdas are implemented.

In src/shopping, there are 3 .kt files.
  main.kt: the main file where the entire calling part and implementation is made
  list.kt: Parent class
  wishlist.kt: Inherited class
  
This program basically implements a shopping list(a wishlist and what can actually be purchased)

Thankyou
